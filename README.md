#   Project description:
    1) Frontend web application.
    2) Created login and signup page and both are linked together so a user could go back and 
       forth through a link. 
    3) The logic for signing up is advanced which detects password's length, characters
       and numbers.
    4) Multiple hooks used such as useState and useEffect.
